# ImmersiveThunder - Forge Edition

A **Forge port** of the popular Fabric mod that adds realistic and dynamic thunder sounds to Minecraft based on the player's distance from lightning strikes.

## 🌩️ Features

- **Distance-Based Thunder Sounds**: Experience realistic thunder that varies based on how far you are from the lightning strike
  - **Close Thunder** (0-64 blocks): Loud, intense thunder when lightning strikes nearby
  - **Medium Thunder** (64-192 blocks): Moderate thunder for strikes at medium distance
  - **Far Thunder** (192+ blocks): Distant rumbling for far-away strikes

- **Sound Variety**: Multiple sound variations for each distance range to prevent repetitive audio
  - 3 close thunder variations
  - 4 medium thunder variations
  - 3 far thunder variations

- **Impact Sounds**: Realistic lightning impact sounds complement the thunder
